**Sencdec**

**Description**

Sencdec is a super encryption-decryption website that allows users to input text for encryption, and the text is randomly encrypted into different letters. Each encrypted sentence or word is accompanied by a unique six-digit code, determining the decryption method to be used.

When decrypting, users need to input the encrypted message in the decryption field, ensuring that the last six digits are included. These digits are automatically included in the encrypted message, and omitting them will result in decryption failure.

This project was completed in 7 to 8 days and involved overcoming challenges with Firebase and decryption processes. With assistance from online resources, including YouTube and ChatGPT, I successfully resolved these issues. The project provided valuable learning experiences across various stages, including planning, starting, designing, implementing functional programs, and reaching the production stage.

While not a perfect project, given that it was my first big project, it served as a significant learning opportunity. Key lessons encompassed the different stages of creating a website or program.

**Features**

Encryption: Input text and receive randomly encrypted output.

Decryption: Input encrypted text along with the six-digit code for decryption.
